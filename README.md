# d7-js-theme-tools

This repo provides some very simple (but hopefully useful) tools that
work with [Drupal 7's javascript theme
API](https://www.drupal.org/node/304258#drupal-theme).

Currently, two functions are provided:

  - `Drupal.theme.cleanAttribute()`: sanitizes an attribute value.
  - `Drupal.theme.attributes()`: creates a properly formatted attribute
    string for use in markup.

Please refer to the javascript files for function arguments and usage.
